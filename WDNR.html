                        <p> The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) manages the state’s 
                            natural resources and provides information on outdoor activities like hunting, 
                            fishing, and hiking. The WDNR website is a vital resource for residents, tourists, 
                            and nature enthusiasts seeking park details, trail maps, permits, and educational 
                            content. However, its complex design creates usability issues, making it difficult 
                            for users to efficiently find park information, obtain permits, or understand 
                            regulations.
                            <!-- Growing up in Kashmir, India, a region with landscapes similar to Wisconsin’s, 
                            I developed a strong connection to nature and sustainability. As an avid user 
                            of the WDNR website, I encountered a few challenges and began to wonder if 
                            other users experienced the same difficulties. -->

                        of the site when performing common tasks related to park visits. 
                        Specifically, to identify usability issues that hinder the 
                        effective completion of key tasks such as applying for licenses, finding

                        <h3>Recruitment method</h3>
                        <p>My recruitment plan for the usability study aimed to engage 
                            a diverse group of participants, including both regular and 
                            occasional users of the website. To ensure varied perspectives, I targeted individuals 
                            with different levels of tech proficiency and demographic backgrounds. </p>

                           
                            Recruitment was carried out through social media platforms, community 
                            groups, and snowball sampling. 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Social Media: A post about the usability study was 
                                    shared in local Wisconsin Facebook groups and Reddit 
                                    forums (r/UWMadison) related to Wisconsin, which helped reach people with an interest in the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR).
                                </li>
                                <li> Snowball Sampling: After recruiting the initial participants, 
                                    we asked them to recommend others who might be interested, which 
                                    broadened the participant pool to include a variety of user experiences.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                           <p> To streamline participant selection, 
                            I utilized a brief screening survey to confirm eligibility. This plan was designed to gather a well-rounded yet fitting perspective on the website’s usability.

                        <h3>Developing Screener Survey</h3>
                        <p>To refine my participant pool, I designed an anonymous screener survey using Google Forms. 
                            By withholding the study's true topic, I ensured unbiased, truthful responses for a reliable selection process. 
                        Further, I made use of targeted questions to ensure that I comply with my selection criteria. 
                        This helped ensure participants matched the typical user base of the Wisconsin DNR website. </p>

                            It was finally the much awaited week of conducting the final usability tests 
                            on the selected participants.This moderated remote usability study evaluated 
                            the Wisconsin DNR website's ease of use, where participants completed tasks 
                            under my guidance (moderator) to simulate an authentic browsing experience.
                            Insights were gathered in real-time from the in-test, pre-test and post-test 
                            questions along with the standardized scores collected to identify usability 
                            challenges and suggest design changes to improve the overall user experience.

                                        The SEQ helps measure the subjective difficulty of performing a specific task on the website.

The rating scale typically ranges from 1 (very difficult) to 7 (very easy).
